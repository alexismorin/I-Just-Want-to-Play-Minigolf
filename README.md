Disclaimer: This was made on the couch in five hours (and then a handful of stolen hours after that) after I realized that there were no (free!) good VR minigolf games available. This is probably pretty buggy in parts.

What this is: 
  - An Oculus VR Unity 2019.2 project
  - A barebones but functional minigolf game
  - Seed-based procedurally generated courses with obstacles

## User Guide
Inside of the StreamingAssets folder (in the project or a build) you'll find the *settings.ini* file.

What it does: 
  - Line 1: Do we use the course in line 2 (1) or generate a new course every time (0)
  - Line 2: The seed for the course being generated - type a random number in and if you like it you can keep it and reuse it. Disregard if you have line one set to generate new courses every time.
  - Line 3: The map size for the course - if you want to share a course with someone ideally you'd have the same size but otherwise numbers from 4 to 20 will work nicely if you want to blow through small courses.
