Disclaimer: This was made on the couch in five hours after I realized that there were no (free!) good VR minigolf games available. This is probably super buggy in parts.

What this is: 
  - An Oculus VR Unity project
  - A functional (and pretty shoddy) minigolf game
  - Seed-based procedurally generated minigolf courses with obstacles


## User Guide
Inside of the StreamingAssets folder (in the project or a build) you''ll find the *settings.ini* file.''

What it does: 
  - Line 1: Do we use the course in line 2 (1) or generate a new course every time (0)
  - Line 2: The seed for the course being generated - type a random number in and if you like it you can keep it and reuse it. Disregard if you have line one set to generate new courses every time.
  - Line 3: The map size for the course - if you want to share a course with someone ideally you'd have the same size but otherwise numbers from 4 to 20 will work nicely if you want to blow through small courses.
 
## Changelog

 - 7/03/2019: initial push
 - 9/03/2019: added autogenerated decorations and trees
